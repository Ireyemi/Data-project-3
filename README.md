# (Ford GoBike System Data Exploration)
## by (Ireyemi Stephen)


## Dataset
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. It contains 183412 observations with 16 associated variables.

After premilinary wrangling(assessing the dataset and cleaning quality issues). My cleaned dataset structure for Ford GoBike's bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area, contains 173272 observations with 17 features.



## Summary of Findings

 The summary of my findings are:

1. Approximately 90.5% of bike users are Subscribers while 9.5% are Customers.

2. Most users of the bike system are the Male gender though the Other gender have the highest average bike-trip duration.

3. The average age of bike users is between age 36 and 37.

4. Most bike-trip durations were less than 60 minutes regardless of the user's age and gender.

5. The FordGo Bike system are used mostly from 7 - 9 am and from 4 - 6 pm. This might be due to the fact that people leave their homes and head back home at those peak hours. Thursday Has the highest number of recorded bike trips in the week.

6. Customers have a generally low number of bike trips than subscribers yet they spend more time riding bikes than Subscribers.

7. There was no correlation between member age and duration(in minutes) of bike-trips.

After carrying out the multivariate analysis, 3am has the highest trip duration average, which was not obvious in our bivariate analysis. with 6am being the least.It was obvious that bike users mostly ride late at night (11pm, 2am and 3am).


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focused on the relationship between FordGo Bike user-types, hour of day of bike trips, week day of bike trips and the duration of bike-trips.

After analyzing the data, it is observed that more than 96% of trips took less than 30 minutes and only 0.79% of trips are of duration more than 1hr. Most rides were done on Thursdays while the weekends(Saturday and Sunday has the least count of trips taken). Despite that fact that we have more subscribers than customers, customers have the longest bike-trip duration.

From a multivariate plot, it is observed in this distribution that users spend more time riding bikes on weekends than weekdays. Bike-trips on weekends are almost 30minutes. During the working days, Monday has the highest duration of average bike use while Tuesdays have the least avergae bike time.

Carring out deeper analysis using heatplots, highest number of subscribers are on Tuesday 8am and Thursday 8am & 5pm having an average of 4000 subscribers. It is obvious that subscribers use bikes everyday of the week at every hour of the day.For customers, Thursday 5pm has the highest bike usage. There are days when customers did not use bikes at some givens hours. This is obvious on Monday and Tuesday 3am and Wednesday 2am.
